## What is it?
Antisocial Engineering is a utility to delete social media posts regularly across a variety of networks. A large amount of hacking that takes place these days relies on social engineering, and the things you post on social media can all provide an attacker with an abundance of information about you. Things that may seem insignificant alone can provide a lot of information when looked at all together. Of course, anything you post online may be archived but this tool attempts to make it harder to aggregate information that hasn't been archived in some way.
